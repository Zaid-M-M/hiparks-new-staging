          At Horizon, our sustainability strategy begins with listening — to our
          people, our partners, and the communities we serve. In 2023, we
          carried out a detailed materiality assessment to pinpoint the ESG
          issues that matter most to our stakeholders and our long-term success.
          Building on this, in 2025, we conducted a Materiality Assessment
          Refresh to ensure our priorities remain aligned with evolving
          stakeholder expectations and business context. By engaging voices
          across our ecosystem — from employees and customers to community
          representatives — we gathered key insights that now shape our
          priorities. The result: a focused, future-ready roadmap that aligns
          our efforts with what truly drives impact.
